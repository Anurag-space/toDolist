# Concurrent File Processor

This Python program reads a large file and processes its content concurrently using threads. Each line is passed to worker threads for processing.

## Usage

1. Place the large file you want to process in the same directory as this script.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script and the large file.

3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python concurrent_processor.py
