# Tic-Tac-Toe Command-Line Game

This is a simple two-player command-line implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses). Players take turns to make their moves, and the game continues until there's a winner or a draw.

## How to Play

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have the Python script for the game.

3. Run the script using Python:

4. The game will start, and you will see an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board:

  |   |   
  |   |   
  |   |   


5. Players take turns to make their moves. When prompted, enter the row (0, 1, or 2) and column (0, 1, or 2) where you want to place your symbol (X or O). For example, if you want to place your symbol in the top-right corner, you would enter "0" for the row and "2" for the column.

6. The game will display the updated board after each move.

7. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

8. If all cells on the board are filled, and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.

9. To restart the game, simply run the script again.
